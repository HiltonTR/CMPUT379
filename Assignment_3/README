CMPUT 379 Assignment 3

Acknowledgements:
    All the acknowledgements for the code are in the code as comments and sources have been provided.
    For conceptual items such as the structure, my previous assignment from when I took the course last
    winter was referenced. Notes from Professor Elmallah were also referenced. All internet references 
    have been listed. Lab slides were also referenced for some implementations.

    Majority of the code structure was based off the geeksforgeeks links in the top of server.cpp.
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-cc/
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-in-cc-handling-multiple-clients-on-server-without-multi-threading/?ref=lbp

    Some assumptions that are made include that the inputs are going to be from input files. It is
    also assumed that tands.c is not to be modified therefore no header file was created.

    Man page references were found below:
