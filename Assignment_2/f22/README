CMPUT 379 Assignment 2

Acknowledgements:
    All the acknowledgements for the code are in the code as comments and sources have been provided.
    For conceptual items such as the structure, my previous assignment from when I took the course last
    winter was referenced. Notes from Professor Elmallah were also referenced. All internet references 
    have been listed. Lab slides were also used to figure out how the pthread commands worked.

    My design choice to implement the synchronization was by using pthreads as it was what was gone over
    in the lab and the familiarity I had of it when I learned about it last term. That was the reason for
    choosing it over using semaphores from <semaphores.h>.
